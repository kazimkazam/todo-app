## Development

This SPA was coded using React together with Redux. Express.js framework was used to handle the REST requests, and a PostgreSQL database makes the state between sessions persistent and stores authentication/authorization related data.

To handle the design of the application, Tailwind CSS was used.

The application is running on:
- react 18.2.0;
- react-dom 18.2.0;
- react-redux 8.0.4;
- react-router-dom 6.4.2;
- redux 4.2.0;
- reduxjs/toolkit 1.8.6;
- express 4.18.2;
- express-session 1.17.3;
- pg 8.8.0;
- Tailwind CSS.
